This is the code for my Master's thesis.
My implementation for the web app is located in the 'src' folder, it contains work related to the road network, routing, and participant matching optimization with IP. It cannot be run, as it does not include the portion that the two students of BME have made, only my code.  
The traffic forecasting code is in the 'Maryland' folder.
